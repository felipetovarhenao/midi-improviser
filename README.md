## Description

**MIDI improviser** is a web application that automatically generates polyphonic music as a MIDI file, based on one or more MIDI input files provided by the user. The degree of freedom or *creativity* of the improviser is determined by a *memory* value. The lower the memory value, the less
similar the resulting music is to the original MIDI, while a higher memory value will generate music that closely resembles the selected
MIDI file(s).
